<body>
    <p>
        The company you work for has just been awarded a contract to build a payment gateway. In order to help move
        things along,
        you have volunteered to create a function that will take a float and return the amount formatting in dollars and
        cents.

        39.99 becomes $39.99

        The rest of your team will make sure that the argument is sanitized before being passed to your function
        although you will need to account for adding trailing zeros if they are missing (though you won't have to worry
        about a dangling period).
    </p>
    <script>
        function formatMoney(amount) {
            return `$${amount.toFixed(2)}`
        }
        console.log(formatMoney(39));
    </script>
</body>
