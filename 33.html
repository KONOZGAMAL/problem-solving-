    <title>Transportation On Vacation</title>
</head>

<body>
    <p>After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you
        and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

        You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes
        you some good offers.

        Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total.
        Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

        Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).</p>
    <script>
        function rentalCarCost(d) {
            let price = 40 * d
            if ( d < 3) {
                return price
            }else if(d >= 7){
                return price - 50
            }else{
                return price - 20
            }
        }
        console.log(rentalCarCost(1));
        console.log(rentalCarCost(3));
        console.log(rentalCarCost(8));
        console.log(rentalCarCost(7));  
    </script>
