    <h2>You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your
        son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.

        As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up
        to and including that number, but excluding zero.</h2>
